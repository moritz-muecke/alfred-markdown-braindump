# Markdown Braindump Alfred Workflow

Puts a string as a markdown checkbox at the end of a file. Based on an idea to easily dump thoughts from my brain into a braindump file within my obsidian vault to keep my mind 
distraction free. You do not need obsidian to use this. The workflow basically just executes a shell script which appends a file with a markdown checkbox prefixed input string.

## Setup:
- Configure the path of your braindump markdown file within the preconfigured environment variable `braindump_filepath`

## Usage:
- Keyword `bd` followed by your input string. Checkbox markdown is prefixed automatically

## Example
- `bd checkout the tasks obsidian plugin`
- `bd call luke for latest updates for the upcoming release`

The result at the end of the markdown file would look like this:
``` markdown
- [ ] checkout the tasks obsidian plugin
- [ ] call luke for latest updates for the upcoming release
```
